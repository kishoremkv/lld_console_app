### Single Responsibility Principle
* A class should have only one responsibility to change
* Easy to maintain
* Easy to understand

### Open/Closed Principle
* Open for extention and closed for modification
* Use a interface and extend it for extention instead of modification

### Liskov Substitution Principle
* Subclass should extend the capability of parent class. It should not narrow it down


### Interfaces Segmented Principle
* Interfaces should be such that, the clients should not implement unnecessary functions they do not need
* So break the interfaces as small as possible


### Dependency Inversion Principle
* Class should depend on interfaces rather than concrete classes
